## üîäüé§ OpenAI Realtime Support (Experimental)

This section covers the Realtime capabilities for AI agent prototyping with OpenAI's Realtime APIs, focusing on speech and text input/output through real-time WebSocket communication.

Please note that these capabilities are offered as an experimental feature. They are intended primarily for exploration, demos, or proof-of-concept usage. 
We do not recommend using these features in production or business-critical applications until further notice.

### Key Features

- **Real-time Audio Interaction**: Use the Realtime API with speech input using predefined and integrated keyword `Computer` to trigger the conversation.
  - Using keyword can be helpful to optimize cost and reliability of your application. To create your own keywords, visit [Creating the Custom Keyword](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/speech-service/custom-keyword-basics?pivots=programming-language-python). Currently only 1 keyword is supported.
- **Real-time Text Interaction**: Use the Realtime API with text input. The agent can respond back with audio or text.
- **Local Voice Activity Detection**: Efficiently manage audio data by detecting speech activities by using local voice activity detection.
- **Function Calling**: Customize the realtime agent with your own functions which runs asynchronously in the background.
- **Configurable AI Options**: Fine-tune realtime agent responses and behaviors with different options in Realtime API.

## ‚ú® Quick Start: Getting Started with the Tool

### Step 1: Complete Azure prerequisities

- Create an Azure Subscription for [free](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/ai-services/), if you don't have one already
- [Apply for access](https://aka.ms/oai/access) to Azure OpenAI Service in this Azure Subscription. Azure OpenAI Service is currently a limited access service so access is granted through an application process. Most applications are processed within a day of applying.
- Azure OpenAI Assistants is currently available in Sweden Central, East US 2, and Australia East. We are expanding our models and regional availability - see the [models guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/models) for the latest model and regional availability for Assistants.
- Create an Azure OpenAI resource on [Azure Portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com) with one of the Assistants supported models from the models guide page deployed in that region

### Step 2: Install Python

The Azure AI Assistant tool requires Python >= 3.8 on your system. You can download Python from [the official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
Latest stable Python version is recommended.

Create a new Python virtual environment. Virtual environment is recommended for safe install the SDK packages:
 * On MacOS and Linux run:
   ```
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```
* On Windows run:
   ```
   py -3 -m venv .venv
   .venv\scripts\activate
   ```

### Step 3: Install the tool and dependencies

Run the following command in your terminal to install all the necessary dependencies as specified in the requirements.txt file.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Build and install azure.ai.assistant Python library (Optional)

We have included the `azure.ai.assistant` library currently within this repository as part of the alpha status of the project. 
The plan is to release library on PyPI for more convenience installation in future.

Build the wheel for `azure.ai.assistant` library using the following instructions, or use the wheel package provided under the repo's release tags directly.

- Python wheel and setuptools packages are required to build the library package. You can install them using the commands: `pip install wheel`and `pip install setuptools`
- Go to the`sdk/azure-ai-assistant` folder
- Build the wheel using following command: `python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel`
- Go to generated `dist` folder
- Install the generated wheel using following command: `pip install --force-reinstall azure_ai_assistant-0.x.xa1-py3-none-any.whl`
  - This installation will pick the necessary dependencies for the library (openai, python-Levenshtein, fuzzywuzzy, Pillow, requests)


### Step 5: Find and copy your Azure OpenAI Service APIkey, endpoint and model deployment version

To successfully make a call against the Azure OpenAI Service, you'll need the following:

**- ENDPOINT:**	This value can be found in the Keys and Endpoint section when examining your resource from the Azure portal. Alternatively, you can find the value in Azure OpenAI Studio > Playground > View code. An example endpoint is: https://docs-test-001.openai.azure.com/.

**- API-KEY:**	This value can be found in the Keys and Endpoint section when examining your resource from the Azure portal. You can use either KEY1 or KEY2.

**- MODEL DEPLOYMENT-NAME:**	This value will correspond to the custom name you chose for your deployment when you deployed a model. This value can be found under Resource Management > Model Deployments in the Azure portal or alternatively under Management > Deployments in Azure OpenAI Studio.

Next, go to your resource in the [Azure portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#home). The Keys and Endpoint can be found in the Resource Management section (see image below). Copy your endpoint and access key as you'll need both for authenticating your API calls. You can use either KEY1 or KEY2. Always having two keys allows you to securely rotate and regenerate keys without causing a service disruption.

### Step 6: Setup Environment Variables

Create and assign persistent environment variables for your key and endpoint.

#### ‚å®Ô∏è Command Line (CLI)

1. Set the Azure OpenAI Service key, endpoint. Version is optional and default currently is `2024-05-01-preview` for assistants.

**Windows:**
Use setx or set command depending on your preference.

```
setx AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY "Your Azure OpenAI Key"
setx AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT "Your OpenAI Endpoint"
setx AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION "Azure OpenAI version"
setx OPENAI_API_KEY "Your OpenAI Key"
```

**Linux/Mac**
```
export AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY="Your Azure OpenAI Key"
export AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT="Your OpenAI Endpoint"
export AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION="Azure OpenAI version"
export OPENAI_API_KEY="Your OpenAI Key"
```

### Step 7: Launch the application

#### ‚å®Ô∏è Command Line (CLI)

In the root of this repository, command:

```
python main.py
